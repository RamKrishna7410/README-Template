## Overview

### Why This Template?

Your time is valuable and should be focused on building amazing projects that solve problems and help others. This
template is designed to streamline the process of creating a README so you can adhere to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
principles even in your documentation efforts. Here's why this template stands out:

- **Efficiency**: Save time by using a pre-structured template.
- **Focus**: Spend more time on developing your project rather than writing documentation from scratch.
- **Versatility**: While no single template can fit all projects, this one aims to be as versatile as possible.

This template will evolve to better meet various needs. Feel free to suggest changes by forking this repo, creating a
pull request, or opening an issue. Contributions are always welcome!
