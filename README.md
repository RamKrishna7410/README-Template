### Why This Template?

Your time is valuable and should be focused on building amazing projects that solve problems and help others. This
template is designed to streamline the process of creating a README so you can adhere to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
principles even in your documentation efforts. Here's why this template stands out:

- **Efficiency**: Save time by using a pre-structured template.
- **Focus**: Spend more time on developing your project rather than writing documentation from scratch.
- **Versatility**: This template aims to be as versatile as possible to fit various projects.

This template will evolve to better meet various needs. Feel free to suggest changes by forking this repo, creating a
pull request, or opening an issue. Contributions are always welcome!

> **Note**
> This is just an example `README` with details and examples.
> If you want a clean format template, use the **[README_TEMPLATE.md](README_TEMPLATE.md)** file as your README.
